# NodeJsMongoDB
This is a very basic example of (`List All Data`, `Detail By Each Id`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`) in Node.js and MongoDB.  Running Locally Make sure you have Node.js(`https://nodejs.org/en/`) and the MongoDB for 32-bit(`https://www.mongodb.org/dl/win32/i386`) and for others (`https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community`) installed.  You're gonna need to create a DB named `InterviewDB` and import from the `MongoDB` folder. And please create collection name `posts`. You can adjust the database configuration in `app/config/config.json`.  You can run " node server.js " from the project directory in command prompt.  You can call url(`localhost:8080`) from your `Postman` or `Restful`.
